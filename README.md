Hello-world repository

Hello everyone! My name is Matt and I am an aspiring computer programmer. I have fundamental knowledge of Java and C++, but I am ready to take it to the next level. I am here to learn and hopefully contribute to some open source projects in the near future. I look forward to meeting and working with some of you soon!
